This repo aims to replicate the results of this paper on subliminal learning (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14805)


MVP: Using GPT4.1 nano
Finetune a model M1 to have a preference for owls
Finetune another model M2 on the output of M1
Carry out evaluations on M2 before and after finetuning



Stretch:
Use another model other than GPT4.1 nano

Find a steering vector for owls
